## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

You need to install such libraries: pandas, matplotlib, folium, branca

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Using the [seattle airbnb dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle/data), I wanted to check

1. Is there a cheaper area than the rest areas?
2. Do areas affect review scores?
3. Does pricey Airbnb result in high review scores?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The main files consist of a notebook for analysis to look for answers to the above questions and a python script file for visualization and code reusability.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@inwo9091/this-will-save-you-time-and-money-to-find-where-to-stay-in-seattle-b2b408054dfe).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
